                        <br>
                       Daniela and Luis met in 2005, during her first trip to Buenos Aires. What was supposed to be Luis's last tanda for the night turned into two hours of dancing together. The magical connection they experienced that night led them to join their paths. Daniela left her career as an MIT engineering professor to become Luis’s tango partner. Luis left Buenos Aires to join her in New York City. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                   Since the beginning of their professional partnership in 2006, Daniela and Luis have established themselves as popular dancers and instructors, as evidenced by their curriculum spanning festivals, workshops and performances in more than 80 cities across four continents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
As performers, Daniela and Luis' found their home in the spontaneity and profound focus of improvisation. Their goal: to feel and to make feel; to lose themselves in a four-way communication with each other, the music and the audience. To that end they greedily avail themselves of techniques and tools across all tango styles, never losing sight that these are only a means and never an end. The result is a charismatic dance that is infused with joy, sincerity heartfulness, and occasional touches of comedy.	
                    
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        They have developed a teaching methodology that leverages Daniela’s engineering, mathematics and classical piano and Luis’s massage therapy backgrounds, prioritizing proper body mechanics, improvisation skills and deep musical understanding over complex sequences of steps. Their ultimate goal is to help students dance with ease and confidence, create a pleasurable experience for their partners and find their own unique tango voice. One such effort to promote these goals is their <a href="http://www.danielayluis.com/#%21immersion-seminar-/c1sj6"> “Buenos Aires Immersion Seminar”</a>, a 20-hour training program with zero complex sequences, focusing on technique, body awareness, connection, musicality and floorcraft, which is offered yearly in Buenos Aires and abroad since 2011.

                        <br>
                       	Dasha started dancing tango in Philadelphia in 2006. It was love from first sight, and it is still going strong. To her, nothing compares to tango in its simplicity and depth of emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	Within a year, Dasha had recognized a need for DJs in her local community and began learning all about tango music from DJs and dancers. Since then, she DJ'd milongas and festivals in many US cities and Buenos Aires. Currently, she is mostly DJing in the Washington D.C. area, enjoying her local community, and serving happiness one tango at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	In our humble opinion, Dasha is awesome.

                      Xavier has an extensive background in music and martial arts that spans overtwo decades. This experience has granted him a facility both in his understanding of the music as well as in his movements. He began his tango studies with the widely respected Marika Landry, where his ease with the dance became immediately apparent. He began teaching at Tango Fabrika in Montreal and and soon became well known throughout North America.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Xavier continues to be passionate about teaching, dancing, and learning. Having spent several months in Buenos Aires studying with Gaston and Moira, he is more inspired than ever and is in high demand at events around the country.

    Geoffrey fell in love with tango music in 2009 after being introduced to it by a friend, and learning to dance at the University of Minnesota Argentine Tango Club. He quickly became part of the club leadership and began to DJ practicas and milongas on a regular basis. Singing with a tango band in Minneapolis further deepened and matured his appreciation of this rich musical genre. He has since been invited to DJ a variety of regional festivals and events across the United States. At every milonga his aim is to select music that keeps dancers returning to the floor tanda after tanda.</p>
